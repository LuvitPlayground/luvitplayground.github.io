## Familiar API

Luvit implements the same APIs as [Node.js][], but in Lua!

This helps teams migrate without having to learn a new way of programming.

[Node.js]: https://nodejs.org/

## Async Choice

Choose your async model; we don't mind; we encourage experimentation.

If you don't like callbacks and event emitters, use coroutines and write
blocking style code without actually blocking your event loop!

## Modular Core

The various projects in the luvit ecosystem can be mixed and matched to build
the ideal runtime for your application.

 - Use luv directly in luajit
 - Use lit without node apis
 - The possibilities are endless

## Using the Node-Style APIs

The `luvit` CLI tool can be used as a scripting platform just like `node`.  This
can be used to run lua scripts as standalone servers, clients, or other tools.

This simple web server written in Luvit responds with "Hello World" for every
request.

```lua
local http = require('http')

http.createServer(function (req, res)
  local body = "Hello world\n"
  res:setHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain")
  res:setHeader("Content-Length", #body)
  res:finish(body)
end):listen(1337, '127.0.0.1')

print('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:1337/')
```

And run this script using `luvit`.

```sh
> luvit server.lua
Server running at http://127.0.0.1:1337/
```

This script is a standalone HTTP server, there is no need for Apache or Nginx to
act as host.

## Using Third-Party Libraries

Luvit also has a package system that makes it easy to publish and consume
libraries.

For example, [@creationix][] has made a set of libraries that use coroutines
instead of callbacks for async I/O and published these to lit.

Using `lit` install `creationix/weblit` to use an express-like framework built
on top of coroutines.

```sh
> mkdir myapp && cd myapp
> lit install creationix/weblit
> vim server.lua
> luvit server.lua
```

The `server.lua` file will contain:

```lua
local weblit = require('weblit')

weblit.app
  .bind({host = "127.0.0.1", port = 1337})

  -- Configure weblit server
  .use(weblit.logger)
  .use(weblit.autoHeaders)

  -- A custom route that sends back method and part of url.
  .route({ path = "/:name"}, function (req, res)
    res.body = req.method .. " - " .. req.params.name .. "\n"
    res.code = 200
    res.headers["Content-Type"] = "text/plain"
  end)

  -- Start the server
  .start()
```
