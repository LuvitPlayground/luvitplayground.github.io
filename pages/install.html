# Installing Luvit

Installing Luvit is a multi-step process currently.  But fear not, it's still quite simple.

## Get Lit and Luvit

If you're on Linux, FreeBSD, or OSX, run the following script to download `luvi` and build `lit` and `luvit` for your platform:

```sh
curl -L https://github.com/luvit/lit/raw/master/get-lit.sh | sh
```

If you're on windows, run the sister command in your `cmd.exe` command prompt.

```bat
PowerShell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command "[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 'Tls12'; iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://github.com/luvit/lit/raw/master/get-lit.ps1'))"
```

Put both `lit` and `luvit` in your path somewhere.  We recommend `/usr/local/bin` or `$HOME/bin` if that's in your path.

To test your install run `luvit` to enter the repl.  This has readline-like capabilities implemented in lua and has tab completion of expressions for interactive exploring the runtime.

## Prebuilt Binaries

While the lit method is quick and easy, we're working on an even easier with pre-bundled `luvit` and `lit` binaries for popular platforms.

Watch this space for updates.

## Compile From Source

If you system is not one of the platforms for which we publish [pre-built luvi binaries](https://github.com/luvit/luvi/releases), you can still build lit from a manually compiled `luvi`.

This requires a C compiler such as gcc, clang, or Visual Studio.  You also need to have [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/) installed and in your path.

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/luvit/luvi.git
cd luvi
make regular
make test
```

The final binary will be at `build/luvi` on most platforms (cmake decides this path).  Once you have this, build lit manually using this luvi.


```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/luvit/lit.git lit-src
./build/luvi lit-src -- make lit-src
```

*Note: if you cloned lit source in to a directory named `lit`, you should to `cd path/to/lit` and then `path/to/luvi . -- make .`*

Or if you want the latest lit release as a zip:

```sh
curl https://lit.luvit.io/packages/luvit/lit/latest.zip > lit.zip
./build/luvi lit.zip -- make lit.zip
```

This will create a `lit` executable in your current directory.  Then you can continue to build luvit normally with:

```sh
lit make github://luvit/luvit
```

And put `lit` and `luvit` in your system path.
