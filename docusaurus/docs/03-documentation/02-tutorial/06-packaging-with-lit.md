# Packaging Made Easy

One final note on the ``deps`` folder: We deliberately chose ``libs/`` for our ``HelloWorldModule.lua`` earlier to distinguish it from the Luvit standard library or other packages, but this is purely a matter of taste. Both ``deps/`` and ``libs/`` will be checked by Luvit's ``require``.

We haven't really established what a "package" actually is, and how it differs from a "bundle". It doesn't really matter when you're just installing them, but if we are to make our own we better know the difference, no?




lit package
package.lua
entry point main.lua
init/deprecated?

lit make
