# Contribution Guidelines

:::info
This section was entirely improvised by the humble author of these pages, and requires input from the Luvit community authors.

*Reason: Are there even any official contribution guidelines? [CONTRIBUTING.MD](https://github.com/luvit/luvit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) is extremely minimalistic and hardly counts.*

## Code of Conduct

:::

There's no official Code of Conduct, but it goes without saying that all communications should be respectful.
